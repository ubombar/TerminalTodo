# TerminalTodo
Terminal Todo is a cross pltform console application (I am intended to design it like vim) that manages my daily todos in a KanBan fasion. For now here are the functionalities.

## Basic Description
TerminalTodo displays and allows user to create the notes. Notes are displayed in a tree structure and they can have couple of attributes. User is allowed to alter those notes.
